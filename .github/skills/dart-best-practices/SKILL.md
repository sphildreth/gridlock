# Dart Best Practices

## 1. When to use this skill
Use this skill when:
-   Writing or reviewing Dart code.
-   Looking for guidance on idiomatic Dart usage.

## 2. Best Practices

### Multi-line Strings
Prefer using multi-line strings (`'''`) over concatenating strings with `+` and
`\n`, especially for large blocks of text like SQL queries, HTML, or
PEM-encoded keys. This improves readability and avoids
`lines_longer_than_80_chars` lint errors by allowing natural line breaks.

**Avoid:**
```dart
final pem = '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n' +
    base64Encode(fullBytes) +
    '\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----';
```

**Prefer:**
```dart
final pem = '''
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
${base64Encode(fullBytes)}
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----''';
```

### Line Length
Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, even in Markdown files and comments.
This ensures code is readable in split-screen views and on smaller screens
without horizontal scrolling.

**Prefer:**
Target 80 characters for wrapping text. Exceptions are allowed for long URLs
or identifiers that cannot be broken.
